## Motivate

Sometimes when I need to convert an exchange rate, I have to search Google for an exchange rate conversion service every time.

I need to find reliable websites **without ads** and this takes me a lot of time. But I need a conversion service, I don't need any other features.

So I made this simple exchange rate conversion site, just for conversions.
